WHERE TO PLAY
-------------

The game is installed at <a href="http://cyr.oglimmer.de">cyr.oglimmer.de</a>. There are also customized rules in play to make the game even more fun ;)

(A) HOW TO INSTALL & DEPLOY ON A SINGLE HOST
--------------------------------------------

1.) install CouchDB on localhost:5984 and create a database called "cyc"

2.) load the views under persistence/src/couchdb/*.json into into localhost:5984/cyc (https://npmjs.org/package/couchviews does the trick easily)

3.) before you build the project you might want to edit the rules under rules/src/main/resources/*.groovy (but for testing purposes the default rules work as well)

4.) set CYC_ENGINE_CONTAINER to an empty directory of your choice

5.) set CYC_WEBAPPS to the webapps directory of a Servlet 3.0 compliant web container (*). Also add -Dcyc.home=$CYC_ENGINE_CONTAINER as JVM parameter

6.) run "install.sh -l site" to build and deploy everything

7.) just start the web server. it will automatically start the engine process

(*) The management script "install.sh" uses Tomcat's (>= 7.x) parallel deployment feature. 

(B) HOW TO INSTALL & DEPLOY VIA VAGRANT/ANSIBLE
-----------------------------------------------

1.) install Vagrant and Ansible (and of course java,maven,npm for the build)

2.) execute install.sh -r [single-vm|multi-vm] site

3.) browse http://192.168.66.2 for single-vm or http://192.168.66.3 for multi-vm

(C) HOW TO INSTALL & DEPLOY VIA DOCKER
--------------------------------------

1.) see docker directory (this is for demonostration purposes only)
